  reconsiderFlesh: `
  Curated by Vivian Qiu and Salome Chatriot

  Reconsider Flesh is a non-chronological, anti-categorical spectrum of digital bodies. This digital sculpture garden presents virtual presentations of skin, flesh, and bone inside a breathing, organic grotto sculpted by Salomé Chatriot. Move through as you navigate the walls Salomé sculpted by capturing data from measuring breathing.

  These bodies are layered with Bella Baguena's distorted readings of Gordon Hall's Why I Don't Talk about 'The Body', a polemic on the turn of phrase "The Body"  and the damaging effects of such language in the english-speaking art world. This space is an embodiment of the multiplicity of flesh, one that Gordon states is too often substituted with the singular verbiage: "The Body." Drawing from her shared experience of "having" a 'trans body,' as it were, Bella Baguena sounds out Gordon's theory inside this fleshy assemblage.

  This body of work is positioned against gatekeeping that excludes bodies that don't fall under the heterocentric, patriarchal lens of the current canon (fat bodies, trans bodies, femme bodies, post-human bodies, trans-human bodies, melanated bodies). Reconsider Flesh carves out a space for just some of the bodies excluded when multitudes are reduced to a monolith.

  walkinsWelcome: `
  Walk-ins Welcome is a digital tattoo showroom of tattoos that incorporate digital mediums (e.g. 3D modeling, virtual reality, digital painting). This space features artists across time zones: from Moscow, Shanghai, Seoul, and the Bay Area. The soundscape is assembled from residual sounds of a tattoo in session.

  Advances in image-rendering have become interwoven into the process of tattooing, and archived onto skin. More and more, this analog art form has seen a shift towards the digital and the experimental. Walk-ins Welcome is a showcase of artists who have embraced this shift in their practice. 

  This sculpture garden features flash available for your skin, etched onto fleshy structures sculpted by Nusi Quero in collaboration with Alex Shilt. The space is encased in skeletal walls sculpted by Lady Bambs. The soundscape is a remote collaboration between Miss Sammie and Nusi Quero, woven entirely from the sounds of tattooing.

  curators: `
  As the core curator of Skin Garden, VIvian Qiu invited anthropologist Venus in Foil and biosynthetic sculptress Salomé Chatriot to co-curate two of the three rooms within Skin Garden. Meshing Venus’ psychoanalytic research, and Salomé’s fluid approach to form, Skin Garden is an exercise in curatorial plurality: a transdisciplinary project.
