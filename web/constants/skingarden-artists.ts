    Candice Saint Williams is a Black queer multimedia artist based in New York City, with an emphasis in sculpture, fiber, and sound. Their process is an exploratory approach in praise of forms, materials and craft traditionally recognized as humble as foundation, storytelling, and collaboration also play a dynamic role. Dismantling domestic motifs from their every day applications informs the artist's work; to challenge their mundane and seemingly concrete design functionality echoes with a spirit of multidimensionality centering identity and experience. 

    An exercise aimed at developing a duality in their process, in contrast to the intricate nature of their interwoven textile sculptures (e.G., dula umblagata, 2017), produced Tooba Greer Williams, a hyper-improvisational musical concept. 
    
    Tooba Greer Williams personifies stream-of-consciousness with illogical, associative, and non-linear lyrical structures. Saint Williams describes it as “bedroom punk”, a nod toward escaping from preciousness in exchange for impulsion, a character trapped in fantasy and unbound. Tooba Greer Williams is a practice of healing via sonic embodiment.

    Salomé Chatriot is a contemporary artist and an mutimedia interaction designer.

    As an artist, her work focuses on the creation of physical and virtual spaces: she builds machines and installations where electronic sculptures and digital images coexist. Fascinated by the way science treats body[ies] through data-oriented objectivity, she uses potential futures and new technologies to shape a fluid, digital and precious identity.

    In disagreement with the techno-negative attitude, the ecosystems she produces always bear the mark of a certain healing. The well-being she wishes to transmit often involves the real-time diffusion of organic flows such as breathing, circulation of liquids and [al] chemical transformations. In her artistic creations, the process is as important as the result: experimenting and manipulating physical, electronic, digital and virtual materials in the manner of a scientist; with rigour and precision.

    Matthieu Jacquet writes about Chatriot's research in Numéro, february 20219: "Anxious to counteract the coldness of the mechanical, the virtual image and the prefabricated, she strives to wrap her creations with the poetry of her universe and the formal softness of her living beings". 

    The images produced by the artist are indeed hybrid and oscillate between biological elements and chromed engines. The coldness of the mechanisms is toned down by the soft colors, pale pinks that evoke the skin, by textures that recall organs and muscular tissues, while the continuous transformation of her substances reflect the involuntary muscular activity of the body, the microscopic cellular life and the liquid heart of the earth.

    Bella Báguena is a Spanish trans non binary woman working with music, performance, jewelry and other media. Bella centers her artistic production in a gender self-examination and an intuitive, emotional process. Using her voice, body movement and identity, as well as objects, spaces and technologies, Bella creates sound, video, sculptural or performative pieces in which the emotional charge and thought load of the trans woman's identity becomes the key signature. 

    Bella’s production works in a nomadic creative process; the disciplines she will be working with depend on her interests and needs of the moment, and possibilities the environment offers, using intuition, motivation and curiosity as a process of learning and creating. Her artistic proposals navigate in between lots of different resources, creating a rich composition of ideas; sourcing from the pop imagery and music and internet culture, to nature, to bodily experience. Organic textures, lights, sound reverbs, the sea and water, hormones, tears, lesbian love stories, the pleasure of the food, or even the trauma coming of misogynist oppression, in public and private spaces, of the trans feminine bodies. Real things that make the Daylife a true, emotional and creative experience. 

    Bella’s objective is the close connection of the emotional experience between her and the spectator, an honest channel to communicate, in which no matter if the tools used are the words and the language, the body expression, or the energy of the voice. The objective is to make the spectator aware of her story and her experience, never letting an artistic production escape its original emotional purpose. Bella communicates something with a creative language, through a trans feminine experience, something that probably we could not understand otherwise.

    Débora Silva is a Portuguese born-and-bred freelance visual artist, currently living in London. Silva studied sculpture at Fine Arts - University of Lisbon and graduated with a bachelor's degree. In 2018 she moved to London and has been living there since, developing her style to what is now wholly recognisable as her own.

    Although Silva specialises in digital art, her work is inspired by the traditional processes of sculpture and primarily revolves around an embodiment of a creature she calls Venus. Venus is an ethereal being; an unknown femme entity, unconventional and powerful, forming a three-dimensional dissident often taking on different forms. Venus creates a narrative that unfolds with its circumstances. By registering “the singular”, Venus represents a collective identity which is returned to reality by the new media, further acquiring new meanings as it passes through time alongside society.

    Silva’s creative process in the virtual space frees her subjects from physical matter, becoming an exercise untethered in the exploration of form. The representation of reality within Silva’s virtual world makes it complicit and critical of contemporary society.

She completed her higher education studies at the University of Seville and the University of the Basque Country, working in advertising and image contexts until 2018, while simultaneously collaborating with visual and musical artists and cultural entities. Teresa Rofer creates pieces where she unfolds, always from an existential and intimist approach, enlightening points of view about the fragility of a utopian individual who does not renounce to express their direct experience of the world. The collective emotional traces which are somatized in the physical body, the intrinsic ambiguities of digital images or the frustrations of individuals exposed to a programmed impersonality. These concepts find in Teresa Rofer’s pieces, endowed with minimal narrative elements, a number of suggestive and novel hybridizations.
